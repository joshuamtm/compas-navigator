✅ **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan** - Detailed action items with timelines and ownership  
✅ **Success Metrics** - Measurable indicators to track your progress  
✅ **Professional Report** - A formatted document you can share with stakeholders (PDF/DOCX/Markdown)

## How Long Does It Take?

- **Total Time**: 15-30 minutes
- **Context Discovery**: 5-10 minutes
- **Objective Definition**: 3-5 minutes
- **Method Selection**: 2-3 minutes
- **Implementation Planning**: 5-7 minutes
- **Assessment & Export**: 2-3 minutes

## Before You Start

### What to Have Ready (Optional but Helpful):
- Meeting notes or documentation about your challenge
- Data or reports that provide context
- Survey results or feedback
- Process documentation
- Any existing analysis or attempts to solve the problem

### What to Think About:
- The specific challenge you want to address
- When this problem started or was noticed
- Who is affected by this challenge
- What impact it's having on your organization
- Any constraints or limitations you're working within

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Context Discovery** (5-10 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI asks clarifying questions to understand your situation
**Your role**: Provide detailed, honest information about your challenge
**Tips**: 
- Be specific rather than general
- Include numbers/data when possible
- Mention stakeholders involved
- Describe the impact on your organization

**Example**: Instead of "We have volunteer problems," say "Our food bank has seen volunteer retention drop from 80% to 45% over the past year, with most volunteers leaving after 2-3 months. This affects our ability to serve 200 families weekly."

### 2. **Objective Definition** (3-5 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI helps you identify the root problem (not solutions)
**Your role**: Focus on *what* the problem is, not *how* to fix it
**Key**: The AI will reject solution-focused statements and guide you to problem-focused ones

**❌ Avoid**: "We need a better volunteer management system"  
**✅ Better**: "We lose 20 hours per month manually tracking volunteer schedules and assignments"

### 3. **Method Selection** (2-3 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI proposes 2-3 different approaches to solve your problem
**Your role**: Review options and select the approach that best fits your resources and constraints
**Tips**: Consider your organization's capacity, budget, and timeline

### 4. **Implementation Planning** (5-7 minutes)
**What happens**: The AI creates a detailed action plan with specific steps
**Your role**: Provide input on timelines, ownership, and resource constraints
**Focus areas**:
- Who will do what
- When tasks should be completed
- What resources are needed
- How to measure success

### 5. **Assessment & Export** (2-3 minutes)
**What happens**: Review your complete COMPAS report and export it
**Your role**: Download your action plan and share with stakeholders
**Formats available**: PDF, DOCX, Markdown

## Best Practices

### Be Specific and Detailed
- Use numbers and data when possible
- Mention specific timeframes
- Name stakeholders and their roles
- Describe measurable impacts

### Focus on Problems, Not Solutions
- Describe what's wrong, not how to fix it
- The AI will redirect you if you focus on solutions too early
- Trust the process - problem definition comes before solution design

### Upload Relevant Documents
- Meeting notes that capture the challenge
- Data showing trends or impacts
- Survey results from affected stakeholders
- Process documentation that provides context

### Be Honest About Constraints
- Budget limitations
- Staff capacity
- Organizational culture
- Timeline restrictions
- Technology limitations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Starting with Solutions
**Wrong**: "We need to implement a new CRM system"  
**Right**: "We spend 15 hours per week manually tracking donor interactions and often miss follow-up opportunities"

### ❌ Being Too Vague
**Wrong**: "Our fundraising isn't working"  
**Right**: "Our annual fundraising has declined 25% over two years, from $150K to $112K, with individual donor retention dropping from 65% to 40%"

### ❌ Focusing on Symptoms Instead of Root Causes
**Wrong**: "Staff are always stressed"  
**Right**: "Our program staff work an average of 50 hours per week due to manual reporting processes that take 10+ hours weekly"

### ❌ Skipping Context
**Wrong**: Jumping straight to "How do we fix this?"  
**Right**: Providing background, stakeholders, impact, and constraints first

## Troubleshooting

### If the AI Seems Confused:
- Provide more specific details
- Include concrete examples
- Mention numbers or timeframes
- Clarify who is involved

### If You're Stuck on Problem Definition:
- Think about what's *not working* rather than what you *want*
- Focus on pain points and inefficiencies
- Consider what would happen if nothing changed
- Ask "What problem would this solution solve?"

### If the Suggested Methods Don't Fit:
- Mention your specific constraints
- Provide more context about your organization
- Ask for modifications or alternatives
- Be specific about why suggested approaches won't work
